Uses Google Closure library from http://code.google.com/closure

Closure in this notebook source tree should be a symlink to the closure
subdirectory of a checkout of closure-library trunk.

For example, what I did:
  % cd .. svn checkout http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ closure-library
  % cd notebook
  % ln -s ../closure-library/closure closure
